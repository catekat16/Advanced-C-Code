# Advanced-C-Code

### [private] 
***All my code from the AP (Advanced Programming in C/C++) course @Columbia (Spring '20)***

I learned a whole lot of C and about UNIX systems programming. I learned things like:
- I/O, Process control, TCP/IP networking
- Sockets API and HTTP protocol
- coding my own web server from scratch in C

### For employment inquiries: ðŸ’¡ 

Due to academic honesty policies, I set the visibility of all the related repos to private, so if you would like to view my work, please email me at caitlyn.chen@columbia.edu and I'll add you as a collaborator!
