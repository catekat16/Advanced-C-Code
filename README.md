# Advanced-C-Code

### [private] 
***All my code from the AP (Advanced Programming in C/C++) course @Columbia (Spring '20)***

This was definitely the toughest required programming course I had taken while at Columbia, but it taught me a whole lot. 

### For employment inquiries: ðŸ’¡ 

Due to academic honesty policies, I set the visibility of all the related repos to private, so if you would like to view my work / assess my knowledge of C, please email me and I'll add you as a collaborator!
